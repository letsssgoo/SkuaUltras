# SkuaUltras
Put scripts under Army folder. I modified the CoreArmyLite so this is a bit different from the Skua's CoreArmyLite.

Edit and fill fields player name, weap, helm, cape

The client crashes when stopping the script on Darkon, and I don't know why. There are no issues when stopping it on other ultras. So, either keep it running until it stops by itself or just don't run Darkon (you can delete 'cUltra.UltraDarkon();' in 0AllUltras.cs) .

Will good if you can refactor and make it better so it can go public.

this script inspired by: INSERTNAMEHERE, you can check his ultra bot on grim [insert's ultra bot](https://github.com/InsertMameHere/InsertGbotHere/blob/main/ULTRAS%20-%20INSERTNAMEHERE.gbot)
